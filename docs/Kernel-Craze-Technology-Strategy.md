# Kernel Craze
## Technology & E-Commerce Strategy
### A Business Plan for Sustainable Growth

---

**Prepared for:** Steven Wolf, Founder
**Date:** January 2026
**Location:** Henderson, NC

---

## Executive Summary

Kernel Craze currently operates on Shopify, paying monthly subscription fees plus transaction fees that reduce profit margins. This document outlines a strategic path to reduce platform dependency, lower fees, and potentially build a custom fundraising system that could become a competitive advantage—keeping more money in Henderson.

**Key Recommendations:**
1. **Short-term:** Migrate from Shopify to WooCommerce (save $500-1,000/year)
2. **Medium-term:** Build custom fundraising module ($5-10K investment)
3. **Long-term:** Consider mobile app if volume justifies ($15-25K)
